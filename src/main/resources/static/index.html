            <p>Find the details of the assignment below, try to limit your time to max 4 hours. Have
                fun!</p>

        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <p>
            Start with cloning the repository containing the service mock found <a
                href="https://bitbucket.org/afklmdevnet/simple-travel-api-mock">here</a>.
            All the details required to start the mock and how to use it can be found in the readme.
        </p>
        <h2>Functional requirements</h2>
        <p>
            The service provides a couple of resources needed to complete the tasks, try them first
            in a client (i.e. postman) to get familiar with them.
            Please do note that the resources are protected and require application level
            authentication (client-id:travel-api-client, secret:psw),
            grant-type is client_credentials.
        </p>
        <h3>Create a user interface</h3>
        <p>
            Create a web user interface where a customer of the site could do the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Be able to select an origin.</li>
            <li>Be able to select a destination.</li>
            <li>Retrieve a fare offer for the given origin-destination combination.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Selections for origin and/or destination should be searchable, in other words the
            customer
            should be able to find an origin or destination by providing a few characters that would
            match either an airport code, name or description. The user interface may be in any tech
            that
            you feel comfortable with.
        </p>
        <h3>Create a backend supporting the user interface</h3>
        <p>
            The user interface requires a dedicated backend that support it, build this in the
            provided
            template using spring-boot.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Proxy requests from the ui to the mock.</li>
            <li>The authentication is on application level, so make sure the user interface is not
                bothered with authentication.
            </li>
            <li>The mock is a bit inefficient, the fare result only returns origin/destination codes
                without any additional details. When handling this request for your user interface
                retrieve details for origin, destination and the actual fare and return a single
                result to
                your user interface. Doing this sequentially would not be very efficient so perform
                these service calls in parallel.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Add statistics for your backend</h3>
        <p>
            To get some input on our application usage we need to collect and store some information
            from its traffic. Retrieve
            and store the require values below.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Total number of requests processed</li>
            <li>Total number of requests resulted in an OK response</li>
            <li>Total number of requests resulted in a 4xx response</li>
            <li>Total number of requests resulted in a 5xx response</li>
            <li>Average response time of all requests</li>
            <li>Min response time of all requests</li>
            <li>Max response time of all requests</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To not only store this data expose this information in a new restful endpoint as JSON
            and
            create a new
            dashboard to visualize this info.
        </p>
        <strong>Collecting metrics should not impact the user experience in any way.</strong>
        <h3>Make the application configurable</h3>
        <p>
            No hardcoded value for thing like endpoints, etc. Everything should be configurable from
            a
            form of configuration file.
        </p>
        <h3>Modulair frontend (FullStack developers only)</h3>
        <p>
            Create a seperate build for your frontend (using npm, gulp and jspm) and build your
            frontend
            in angular (which version is up to your own preference)
            and make sure that somehow your resulting artifact is <strong>included and
            exposed</strong>
            in your boot project.
        </p>
        <h3>Bonus points</h3>
        <p>Bonus points can be earned by implementing any or all of the additional tasks below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a new page where you can see a list of all airports (and be able to search on
                them)
                and paginate the results.
            </li>
            <li>The mock service does not provide any form or sorting, find a way to add sorting
                without having to change the original mock
            </li>
            <li>Provide a threadname that looks like 'async-task-{thread_id}' for all threads that perform async tasks.</li>
            <li>Provide a unique ID to each request for tracking purposes and have <strong>every</strong> log line include it before the message.</li>
            <li>Show us your knowledge of java up to and including the latest released version!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            By no means is the goal to get a solution covering all special cases in a 100% robust
            way. Requiring this
            would be naive. At least the functions described shall be error free when used
            correctly, how everything
            else is handled is subject to creativity and ambition.
